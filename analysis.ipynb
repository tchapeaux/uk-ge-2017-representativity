    "# Assessing the representativity of the UK Parliament following the 2017 General Election\n",
    "\n",
    "Or: how Theresa May came into power with less than a third of the UK casting a vote for her party.\n",
    "\n",
    "TL-DR: FPTP + abstention\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK (as many western democracies) is a representative democracy, meaning it elects people to represent them and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is as follow: the UK is geographically divided into 650 **constituencies** of roughly the same number of voters, each of which holds a mini-election for one **seat** in the House of Commons.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mini-elections are done using what is called a **First-Past the Post** (FPTP) system, meaning all voters cast one vote for one of the candidate, and the candidate with the more votes wins the seat. This system has the advantage of being easy to understand and put in place, but also has several drawbacks. For example, a candidate does not need 50% support to win, just having the highest score (votes might be split e.g. 45-40-15).\n",
    "\n",
    "The population legally allowed to cast a vote is called the **electorate**. The number of **valid votes** (votes which are counted to determine seats) is however smaller than the number of people in the electorate, as voting is not mandatory and some votes might be spoiled (i.e. made unvalid for a variety of reasons). The ratio of valid votes against the electorate is called the **turnout**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the election, the **government** is elected based on a majority of seats in the House of Commons. The government can then propose all sort of ideas to improve the country, in the form of laws that are voted in the House of Commons by their majority.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the whole process, candidates are organized into **parties**, which publish a political **manifesto** prior to the election. When you are deciding which candidate to vote for, you can refer to the manifesto to know what are the laws they are planning to pass if they take part in a government.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many additional subtleties to consider (electoral pacts, majority or coalitions governments, the official opposition, party leaders, the Monarch's role, etc.) but we will ignore them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2017 Result\n",
    "\n",
    "See https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2017/results\n",
    "\n",
    "Turnout was 68.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the election, a government was formed by the *Conservative* party, with support from the *Democratic Unionist Party*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at how well the parliament, and the government, actually represent the electorate, using two metrics:\n",
    "1) how many eligible voters have voted for an actual member of the House of Commons\n",
    "2) how many eligible voters have actually voted for the government's manifesto.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hypotheses:\n",
    "- We assume voters vote for a party, not a candidate\n",
    "- We assume voters vote for their preferred choice\n",
    "- We assume non-voters were not satisfied with any of the choices\n",
    "\n",
    "About the 2nd hypothesis, we know that it is not exactly the case: as a consequence of FPTP, some people will vote \"tactically\" for a less-liked but better-placed candidate. This means our analysis will be optimistic relating to the representativity of Parliament.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is from the Electoral Commission website and can be found here : https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/who-we-are-and-what-we-do/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/uk-general-elections/results-and-turnout-2017-uk-general-election\n",
